----------------------

This project is a fork off of https://github.com/evanw/fsm with some major 
changes in the behaviour with some fixes as well.

To run the project locally open the index.html file in the browser.
To make changes you need to run the build.py script since it compiles
all the js files into one js file named fsm.js.
